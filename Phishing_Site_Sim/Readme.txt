This is a phishing simulation website using the domain name of http://www.caresync.com

It is not meant to be tested or used outside of a sandboxed kali linux homelab environment and any attempt to do so will result in errors or a failure to access the site and access its features without extensive reconfiguration. The site uses a template from the "OnePage.com" website that was chosen because it looked authentic and I wanted to play around with the css and html code. 

I would eventually like to introduce more penetration testing capabilities in the range of xss attacks, dns poisoning, and RAT injection. I want to study lateral movement and how different APTs are able to gain intial access. This will most likely come after completing more of my degree plan.
